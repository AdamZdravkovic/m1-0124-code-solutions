## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

The parts of a function definition include the function keyword, the function name, parameters (if any), and the function body enclosed in curly braces.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

The parts includes the function name followed by parentheses, and any arguments passed within the parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

A function definition specifies the name, parameters, and the code block for a function, while a function call invokes or executes the function with specified arguments.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A parameter is a variable in a function definition and an argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

They allow functions to accept input data and making them more flexible.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

`return` statement gives a value back to the caller and stops the function's execution.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?

Consists of parentheses for parameters, followed by the arrow '=>' and the function body.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?

It automatically returns the expression following the arrow.
