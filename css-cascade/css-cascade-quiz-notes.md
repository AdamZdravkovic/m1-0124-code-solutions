## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".

Specificity, importance, source order and inheritance.

- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?

"source order" refers to the precedence given to CSS rules based on their sequential order within the stylesheet or across linked stylesheets, where rules defined later override conflicting rules defined earlier.

- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?

Through the inheritance mechanism, where certain properties cascade from parent elements to their children by default.

- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.

ID, class and type selectors.

- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?

It can lead to specificity conflicts, reduced maintainability, and difficulties in debugging and overriding styles.
